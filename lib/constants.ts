In 2019 UGC, MHRD declared this institution as Category I Institution. The first off campus has come up in A.Y 2018-2019 at Hyderabad, Moinabad, Aziznagar Road, near TSPA Junction, on the road leading to Chilkur Balaji temple. KLEF Deemed to be University has inaugurated its second off campus in A.Y. 2023-2024 in Bowrampet Village, Medchal, Malkajgiri District, Greater Hyderabad. KLEF (Deemed to be University) offers outstanding undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes in engineering and management streams from two campuses Vijayawada and Hyderabad. KLEF has established an ecosystem to promote innovation, including a centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship Cell (IIEC), leading to start-ups in different disciplines. Through publishing research articles in various national and international refereed journals, particularly in Scopus/WoS/SCI Indexed journals, research has taken a quantum leap towards improving its quality, resulting in good h-index.",
